      <title>Scope insensitivity and d3.js</title>

      <description>tl;dr: Check out my Observable notebook showing how vast the scale of factory farming is.
 Scope insensitivity is our inabiity to grasp really large numbers. When you think about the difference between a million people and a billion people, your brain can&amp;rsquo;t really represent that thousandfold difference, so it gets compressed down to being abstractly &amp;lsquo;larger&amp;rsquo;. We don&amp;rsquo;t suffer the same bias with quantities small enough to visualise.</description>

      <title>Blagging your way through d3.js</title>

      <description>With twelve weeks to do whatever programming projects I wanted, I figure now is the time to try something I&amp;rsquo;ve never touched before.
Data visualisation is totally foreign to me (at least, anything beyond charts in Excel is). I was aware of d3.js, a JavaScript library for graphing data, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try it out.
Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;library for graphing data&amp;rdquo; at all. It&amp;rsquo;s really a DOM manipulation library, or a library for processing data and using it to update elements on a webpage.</description>

      <title>Hey, Cochrane - quick answers to medical questions</title>
      <link>https://recurse.henrystanley.com/post/hey-cochrane/</link>

      <description>Cochrane is a body which produces meta-analyses on medical topics – basically, they pick a subject to review, trawl through all the existing scientific papers that have been published, throw away almost all of them because they&amp;rsquo;re too small, not statistically rigorous, or have some other methodological problem, and then use what&amp;rsquo;s left to make a judgement on the topic.
Cochrane reviews are pretty much the gold standard for &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; in medical science.</description>

      <title>Becoming a dramatically better programmer</title>
      <link>https://recurse.henrystanley.com/post/better/</link>

      <description>In our first week, we were told that the RC faculty wanted to do one thing above else – to remove any obstacles in the way of us becoming dramatically better programmers.
But what does that mean? What does getting dramatically better actually look like?
I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined a few broad areas that programmers striving to get better might focus on. I&amp;rsquo;ve also suggested some ways to tackle these areas – but this is by no means complete, or correct!</description>

      <title>Learning Programming Languages with Spaced Repetition</title>
      <link>https://recurse.henrystanley.com/post/spaced-repetition/</link>

      <description>The spacing effect shows that the most efficient way to learn material is to expose yourself to it at increasing intervals, instead of cramming. Spaced repetition learning uses this effect to show you flashcards at intervals optimised for knowledge retention.
This is especially good for learning languages – it&amp;rsquo;s how Duolingo decides when to show you old vocabulary to review. So why not use it for learning programming languages as well?</description>

      <title>BitTorrent clients for fun and profit</title>
      <link>https://recurse.henrystanley.com/post/bittorrent-client/</link>

      <description>This is a work in progress.
&amp;hellip;well, not really for profit. The world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need another BitTorrent client. But it&amp;rsquo;s a great project for learning about an interesting web protocol, exploring the networking stack, getting to grips with Wireshark and debugging, and learning how things work.
Reading a .torrent The torrent files you might find somewhere like The Pirate Bay are encoded with bencode (pronounced &amp;ldquo;B-Encode&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m still gonna say &amp;ldquo;ben-code&amp;rdquo;), a terse file format for representing a few simple data structures (strings, ints, dicts and lists).</description>
