      <description>The spacing effect shows that the most efficient way to learn material is to expose yourself to it at increasing intervals, instead of cramming. Spaced repetition learning uses this effect to show you flashcards at intervals optimised for knowledge retention.
This is especially good for learning languages – it&amp;rsquo;s how Duolingo decides when to show you old vocabulary to review. So why not use it for learning programming languages as well?</description>

      <title>BitTorrent clients for fun and profit</title>

      <description>This is a work in progress.
&amp;hellip;well, not really for profit. The world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need another BitTorrent client. But it&amp;rsquo;s a great project for learning about an interesting web protocol, exploring the networking stack, getting to grips with Wireshark and debugging, and learning how things work.
Reading a .torrent The torrent files you might find somewhere like The Pirate Bay are encoded with bencode (pronounced &amp;ldquo;B-Encode&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m still gonna say &amp;ldquo;ben-code&amp;rdquo;), a terse file format for representing a few simple data structures (strings, ints, dicts and lists).</description>
